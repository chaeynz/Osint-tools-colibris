Colibris will be a software that will allow you to have information on an e-mail address, an IP address, a telephone number, a username, and other things will come later. For the moment, only 2 of these 4 functions are working. I've been working on it alone for quite a while now. I'm thinking of offering 2 free versions if my work makes any noise. One will be released on 24 August and another in more than 2 months. This will give you an idea of my software! Here are a few screenshots of the interface and the data it will be able to collect

!!Update of the 10/08/2023!!
I've added the number of days remaining for the software to the interface. I've finished the phone number. Now it will give you the carrier, the country, the timezone and whether it is valid or not. Tomorrow I'll be working on the email information, trying to fix a few problems. 

!!Update of the 11/08/2023!!
I'm not going to lie to you, webscraping the epios site to get information on an email address is harder than expected! In addition, I'm planning to create external software that will be dedicated solely to web scraping the epios website. In the meantime I'm running the colibris project with the 2 functions that work. Another project for this web scraping will arrive soon!
